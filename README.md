# defer.php

ðŸ”Œ defer.php is a PHP helper class helping you to integrate my beloved [defer.js](https://github.com/shinsenter/defer.js) library into your websites.

defer.js is a super tiny, native performant library for lazy-loading JS, CSS, images, iframes...

Easily speed up your website! Hope you guys like it.



## How to use



### Install with composer

```bash
composer require shinsenter/defer.php:dev-master
```



### Basic usage

```php
// Include the library
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/shinsenter/defer.php/defer.php';

// Create a Defer object
$defer = new \shinsenter\Defer();

// Process the HTML
$response->setContent($defer->from()->toHtml($html));

// Read HTML source from file
$html_source = file_get_contents('mypage.html');

// Then get the optimized output
$result = $defer->fromHtml($html_source)->toHtml($html);
var_dump($result);

// Load another HTML without creating new object
// You can write all methods in one line like this
$result = $defer->fromHtml(file_get_contents('otherpage.html'))->toHtml();
var_dump($result);
```
